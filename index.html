      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello everyone! I’m <b>HyperNeutrino</b>, admin / lead dev / council advisor for <b>Shenhe Mains</b>. If I haven’t had the chance to talk to you yet, it’s nice to meet you. I’m a 19-year-old CS student mostly passionate about programming and video games and I recently got involved in SHM because I saw the staff application on the subreddit and now I’m here.</p>
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      <p>I care a lot about maintaining high server quality (in terms of server structure, organization, and environment) and organization (in terms of staff, managing timelines and deadlines, etc.) and I feel that this is important to have for TCN. While I am pretty new here, I’ve learned a lot already and I believe my desire and ability to always keep learning new things and improving is also a benefit. Lastly, I value transparency and maintaining open communication, which I believe are important for meeting everyone’s needs best and maintaining a good and solid reputation with our servers and their members.</p>
      <p>As a current moderator on Stack Exchange (<a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/68942/hyper-neutrino" target="_blank">profile link</a>), I have experience with some content and chat moderation but mostly community organization and leadership, organizing and running events, and representing my community and relaying communication between my community and the network employees.</p>
      <h3>My "campaign promises" / ideas</h3>
      <p>There are a couple of things I have noticed from when I started in SHM, with some private interactions, and from my own observations in HQ that I believe are issues with TCN. Some are not that serious like ban-share vulnerabilities, inconsistent standards, or a feeling that some ban-shares are uncalled for, unreasonable, or due to bad moderators on other servers, but some are more serious like a sense of TCN being pretentious or egotistical or petty, trying to hold a monopoly on Genshin Mains servers and instating their own ideals, etc.</p>
      <p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>I believe that we need a TCN server for people who want to know about decisions and changes that happen, or a news channel to keep people updated.</li>
          <li>Changes to policy, ongoing projects, and the reason for decisions like new executives/observers, servers being induced (and maybe starting observation or being rejected, depending on how much that can be public), constitution changes, etc. should all be announced and not silently done.</li>
          <li>It’s impossible not to be biased, but I’ve seen concerns or mentions of cronyism / heavy advantages for being part of the same friend group or a clique-y feel from TCN, and I think it’s important that we are transparent with our decisions and give reasoning for our choices to avoid this appearance.</li>
          <li>Decisions take way too long to happen and it seems like not much is changing (after alpha’s “do anything” vote suggestion nearly a month ago, I haven’t really seen all that much been done despite a lot of discussion about all sorts of ideas), so as an executive, I would set clear timelines for new ideas and introduce deadlines and a clear action plan to make things actually happen.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>What to expect if you vote for me</h3>
      <p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>A leader who can organize changes, moderate discussions, respond well to feedback, and maintain transparency and open communication.</li>
          <li>A helper who can provide advice and assistance for servers in terms of organizing staff structure, keeping the technical aspect (permissions, channel structure, etc.) functioning well, etc.</li>
          <li>A representative who can establish communication with the community and individual servers and build a solid reputation for quality and shared interest in building and supporting each of our servers.</li>
          <li>A better poll bot because I hate Pollmaster someone please help every time I look at its interface and press the reaction only to have to wait 20 seconds for it to send me a double DM in the worst format possible I slowly lose more of whatever little remains of my sanity someone save me from this torment.
        </ul>
